    <h1>My Code Plateau Experience</h1>
<hr>
    <h2 id="moon">Day 1</h2>
    <p>It was 6:30am when my alarm rang, it is the first day of the week, 
        a monday morning. I quickly got to the bathroom as i can smell the aroma 
    of the jollof rice and brother is making in the kitchen. As i round up getting 
    myself ready i got to the kitchen to serve myself a bit of heaven. Less i forget 
    to say my brother is a chef, you can visit his site at 
    <a href="www.coldstone.com" target="_blank">Goldenhut Delights.</a> This is an image from his 
    kitchen. <br><a href="www.coldstone" target="_blank"> <img src="Jollof.jpg"

    <br> Send him and order on <a href="mailto:ddoupoylad@gmail.com" target="_blank"

    <p>Quikly, I picked my bag which contains my <strong>laptop, jotter, mouse pad and extention cable</strong> 
    as the clock apporaches 8:00am. The <b>Code Plateau Class 3.0</b> 
    is scheduled for <em>9:00am daily</em> which our instructor lucky urges us to
    </p>
    <p>use the pic to order variety. <br>

<h2>Day 2</h2>
<p>
    It was a long night, because i could not get much sleep.
    I was up all night practicing what was taught in class, the excitement of 
    manipulating the web structure was mind blowing and I got lost in the <em>euphoria</em> that 
    I lost track of time.
